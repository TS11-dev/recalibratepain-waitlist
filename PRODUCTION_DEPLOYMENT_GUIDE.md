# PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT GUIDE - RECALIBRATE WEBSITE

## Overview
Your actual production deployment stack:
- **Frontend**: Vercel (recalibratepain-waitlist-izl3w3a2d-ts11-devs-projects.vercel.app)
- **Custom Domain**: www.recalibratepain.com
- **Backend**: Railway (recalibratepain-waitlist-production.up.railway.app)
- **Database**: MongoDB Atlas (recalibrate-waitlinglist)

## üö® CURRENT STATUS

**Frontend (Vercel)**: ‚úÖ DEPLOYED
- URL: https://recalibratepain-waitlist-izl3w3a2d-ts11-devs-projects.vercel.app
- Custom Domain: https://www.recalibratepain.com  
- Status: Ready for production

**Backend (Railway)**: ‚ùå DOWN
- URL: https://recalibratepain-waitlist-production.up.railway.app
- Status: Returns 404 "Application not found"

## üîß IMMEDIATE FIXES NEEDED

### 1. Railway Backend Deployment
**CRITICAL**: Your Railway backend is completely down. To fix:

1. **Check Railway Dashboard**: 
   - Log into Railway console
   - Verify deployment status
   - Check build logs for errors

2. **Common Railway Issues**:
   - Environment variables not set
   - Build command incorrect
   - Port configuration wrong
   - Python dependencies missing

3. **Required Environment Variables**:
   ```
   ENVIRONMENT=production
   PORT=8001
   MONGO_URL=mongodb+srv://tristansiokos24:Password456@recalibrate.blvevp8.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Recalibrate
   ```

### 2. Update Frontend Environment
Once Railway backend is fixed:

**In Vercel Environment Variables**, set:
```
REACT_APP_BACKEND_URL=https://recalibratepain-waitlist-production.up.railway.app
GENERATE_SOURCEMAP=false
INLINE_RUNTIME_CHUNK=false
```

## üéØ DEPLOYMENT VERIFICATION STEPS

Once Railway backend is restored:

1. **Test Backend Health**:
   ```
   curl https://recalibratepain-waitlist-production.up.railway.app/api/health
   ```
   Should return: `{"status":"healthy","service":"RecalibratePain Waitlist API"}`

2. **Test Frontend Integration**:
   - Visit: https://www.recalibratepain.com
   - Test email signup form
   - Verify subscriber count updates
   - Check newsletter button works

3. **Verify Database Connection**:
   - Backend should connect to MongoDB Atlas
   - Dual storage (MongoDB + JSON backup) should work
   - Email submissions should persist
