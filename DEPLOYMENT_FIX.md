# 🚀 FIXED: Railway Deployment Instructions

## ✅ Issue Resolved
The Dockerfile is now in the **root directory** (`/app/Dockerfile`) where Railway expects it.

## 🔧 Railway Dashboard Settings
1. **Root Directory**: Leave EMPTY (use root directory)
2. **Builder**: `Dockerfile`
3. **Environment Variables**: Railway will automatically provide `PORT`

## 📁 File Structure
```
/app/
├── Dockerfile          ← NOW HERE (Railway looks for this)
├── railway.json        ← Root configuration
├── backend/
│   ├── server.py       ← Your FastAPI app
│   ├── requirements.txt
│   ├── waitlist.json
│   └── ...
└── frontend/
    └── ...
```

## 🔄 What I Fixed
- ✅ Moved Dockerfile to root directory
- ✅ Updated Dockerfile paths to copy from `backend/` folder
- ✅ Simplified railway.json configuration
- ✅ Removed root directory specification from Railway config

## 🚀 Deploy Now
Your Railway deployment should now work! The Dockerfile is in the correct location and properly configured.

## 🐛 If Still Issues
1. Check Railway dashboard shows "Dockerfile" as builder
2. Ensure no "Root Directory" is set (leave empty)
3. Verify the build logs show the Dockerfile being found
