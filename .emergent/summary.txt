<analysis>
The previous AI engineer's trajectory on RecalibratePain primarily focused on an intensive, iterative UI/UX design overhaul following initial backend setup. A major early hurdle was resolving persistent CORS issues, which involved correctly configuring frontend environment variables. The bulk of the work revolved around implementing and refining custom, world-class animations—evolving from abstract shapes to specific biological diagrams (DNA, cell, lungs, heart)—to frame the header content.

Throughout this, the engineer battled user frustration due to changes not appearing, leading to the discovery of a critical issue: two React frontends, with supervisor running the incorrect one. This was fixed by copying changes and removing the duplicate. Git corruption later emerged as a blocker for deployment. Concurrently, extensive efforts were made to adjust component spacing, remove UI borders, and update text, all while debugging Railway deployment failures related to Python environment detection, necessitating changes to  and adding  and . The process highlights a loop of user feedback, code modification, and complex debugging of environment and deployment configurations.

<product_requirements>
The RecalibratePain application is intended to be a pre-launch landing page featuring email collection for a waitlist and donation functionality. The core problem is to provide a fully functional, deployable MVP with a world-class, modern, and futuristic UI/UX.

Key product requirements and implementations so far include:
*   **Core Functionality**: Email collection for waitlist, PayPal integration for donations, and an About section.
*   **UI/UX Design**: Emphasis on a modern, futuristic aesthetic with custom, purposeful, moving graphical animations.
*   **Animations Evolution**: Initial abstract animations (blobs, lines) were rejected. User explicitly requested specific biological diagrams (molecule, cell, lungs, skeleton, heart), then genius artwork like walking human, phoenix, brain neural art, DNA transformation, and healing energy figures. These animations are to act as decorative flare around the header, not as separate content sections.
*   **Readability & Layout**: Ensure text is readable and not obscured by animations. Adjust header text structure and spacing. Animations should fill header space without overlapping text. Sections should appear as contained cards with proper spacing, not edge-to-edge.
*   **Color Scheme**: Purple-dominant with white/blue/black accents.
*   **Error Resolution**: Address 70+ console errors, particularly CORS and  issues.
*   **Text Updates**: Change business email to . Update headline text to Track symptoms, learn from pain science, build your care team, use our built in therapeutic tools and get AI-powered insights to personalize your painful experience and live to your best. Update social proof sections: 200+ Tools and Lessons (instead of 8 Health Systems Tracked) and ∞ Potential (instead of Days in Development).
*   **Deployment**: Provide guidance for Railway (backend) and Vercel (frontend) deployment, including DNS configuration, and verification for live payments and email collection (off sandbox).

<current_work>
Immediately prior to this summary, the AI engineer was intensely focused on debugging and resolving the backend deployment failures on Railway. The recurring error is  during the build phase, indicating Railway's Nixpacks builder is not correctly detecting or setting up the Python environment.

To address this, the AI engineer has:
1.  Created  with  to explicitly inform Railway about the Python version.
2.  Created  for more explicit Nixpacks configuration.
3.  Created  as an alternative build strategy, suggesting the user switch Railway's builder to Dockerfile mode.
4.  Modified  and the root  to include correct  and  and specify .
5.  Repeatedly instructed the user to manually configure the Railway dashboard settings, specifically the Root Directory to  and to change the Builder from Nixpacks to Dockerfile.

The current state is that the code changes to support Railway deployment have been made locally (e.g., , ), but the persistent Git corruption issue () prevents pushing these changes to GitHub. The user is also expressing frustration that changes are not reflecting, implying caching or incorrect deployment settings are still an issue on their end with Railway, despite the local code being updated. The last action was the AI engineer preparing to force-add and commit the changes to overcome the Git corruption.
