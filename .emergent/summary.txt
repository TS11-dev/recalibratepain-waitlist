3.  A new section for Protocol should be created, which links to an external page: .
4.  A Go to App button should be added to the top-right of the navigation bar, linking to .
5.  A Back to Home button should be present on all sub-pages (Features, Pricing, etc.).
6.  The UI for the hub cards and navigation bar needs to be improved for better aesthetics and layout.

The text Get instant access to our free Self-Management 101 course when you join should be removed from the footer and the welcome email.
