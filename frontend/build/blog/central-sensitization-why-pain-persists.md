# Central Sensitization: Why Your Pain Persists After Healing

**Category:** Pain Science | **Read Time:** 11 min | **Date:** January 27, 2026

Your injury healed months ago, but the pain remains. Central sensitization explains why: your nervous system has become hypersensitive. Understanding this science is the first step to rewiring it.

## Why Does My Pain Persist After Healing?

**Your injury healed. The scans are clear. But the pain remains.**

This is one of the most frustrating experiences in chronic pain, and it's incredibly common. The answer lies in how your nervous system has adapted.

**Central sensitization** is when your central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) becomes hypersensitive to pain signals. Think of it like a smoke alarm that's been turned up too high. It now goes off for toast, not just fire.

**What's happening in your body:**
- Neurons become more excitable (lower threshold to fire)
- Pain signals get amplified on the way to the brain
- The brain's pain-dampening systems weaken
- Pain spreads beyond the original site
- Normal sensations start feeling painful

**This is NOT "in your head." It's a real, measurable change in how your nervous system functions.**

## What Are the Signs of Central Sensitization?

**How do you know if your nervous system has become sensitized?**

**Key indicators:**

**Allodynia** (pain from non-painful stimuli):
- Light touch hurts
- Clothing or sheets feel painful
- Gentle pressure causes pain

**Hyperalgesia** (exaggerated pain response):
- Minor bumps cause significant pain
- Small injuries hurt way more than expected
- Pain is disproportionate to cause

**Widespread symptoms:**
- Pain has spread beyond original site
- Multiple body areas affected
- Migratory pain that moves around

**Other signs:**
- Heightened sensitivity to light, sound, or smells
- Fatigue that doesn't improve with rest
- Brain fog and concentration difficulties
- Sleep disruption
- Temperature sensitivity

**Conditions associated with central sensitization:**
- Fibromyalgia
- Chronic fatigue syndrome
- Irritable bowel syndrome
- Chronic headaches/migraines
- Chronic low back pain
- Complex regional pain syndrome

## Can Central Sensitization Be Reversed?

**Here's the good news: neuroplasticity works both ways.**

The same brain changes that created sensitization can be directed toward **desensitization**. Your nervous system learned to amplify pain. It can learn to turn down the volume.

**What helps:**

**Pain neuroscience education:**
- Understanding WHY you hurt reduces threat perception
- Knowledge itself is therapeutic
- Changes how the brain interprets signals

**Graded exposure:**
- Slowly reintroducing feared movements and activities
- Building confidence in your body
- Proving to your nervous system that movement is safe

**Exercise:**
- Releases natural pain-relieving chemicals
- Improves sleep and mood
- Builds physical resilience
- Must be gradual and paced

**Stress management:**
- Chronic stress fuels sensitization
- Relaxation techniques calm the nervous system
- Mindfulness reduces pain catastrophizing

**Sleep optimization:**
- Poor sleep worsens sensitization
- Restorative sleep allows healing
- Sleep hygiene is foundational

**The key:** Treatment must address the nervous system, not just the tissues. That's why injections and surgeries often don't help sensitized pain.
