# Activity Pacing: How to Break the Boom-Bust Cycle in Chronic Pain

**Category:** Self-Management | **Read Time:** 9 min | **Date:** January 25, 2026

Do you push through on good days only to crash afterward? The boom-bust cycle keeps millions trapped in pain flares. Activity pacing is the evidence-based technique that breaks this pattern for good.

## What Is the Boom-Bust Cycle?

Sound familiar? You have a good day, so you push through everything on your to-do list. The next day (or two, or three), you're completely wiped out, in more pain than before.

This is the **boom-bust cycle**, and it's one of the most common patterns in chronic pain and fatigue conditions.

**The pattern looks like this:**
- **BOOM:** Feel okay → Do too much → Ignore warning signs
- **BUST:** Crash → Increased pain → Forced rest → Guilt and frustration
- **Repeat:** Feel slightly better → Overcompensate → Crash again

**Why it's so damaging:**
- Creates unpredictable, roller-coaster symptoms
- Leads to deconditioning over time
- Increases fear and avoidance of activity
- Makes planning and commitments nearly impossible
- Worsens pain sensitivity through repeated flares

## What Is Activity Pacing?

**Activity pacing is a structured approach to breaking the boom-bust cycle.**

Instead of being driven by how you feel in the moment, pacing means:
- Setting **time-based limits** on activities
- Taking breaks **before** you need them
- Maintaining **consistent** activity levels regardless of pain
- Gradually building capacity over time

**The core principle:** Do less on good days and more on bad days to create a steady baseline.

**Research shows pacing helps:**
- Reduce frequency and severity of flares
- Build sustainable activity tolerance
- Increase confidence in your body
- Improve quality of life and function

## How Do I Find My Baseline?

**Your baseline is the amount of activity you can do WITHOUT triggering a flare.**

**Step 1: Track your current patterns**
For 1-2 weeks, note:
- What activities you do
- How long you do them
- Pain levels before and after
- Any flares and what preceded them

**Step 2: Identify your tolerance**
Look at activities that DON'T cause flares. How long can you:
- Walk before symptoms increase?
- Sit at a computer?
- Stand while cooking?
- Do housework?

**Step 3: Set your starting point**
Take **50-80% of your comfortable time** as your baseline.

*Example: If you can walk 20 minutes before pain increases, start with 10-15 minute walks.*

**Why start lower?** This builds in a safety margin and creates room for gradual progress.

## How Does Recalibrate Help with Pacing?

**Pacing requires data, and that's where Recalibrate shines.**

**Track activities and symptoms together:**
- Log what you do and how long
- Record pain, fatigue, and other symptoms
- See patterns over days and weeks
- Identify YOUR specific triggers and tolerances

**Set goals and monitor progress:**
- Create activity goals based on your baseline
- Track completion and adjust as needed
- Celebrate consistent progress, not perfection

**Learn the science:**
- Pain Science Academy lessons on pacing
- Understanding the nervous system's role
- Why consistency beats intensity

**Share with your care team:**
- Show clinicians your activity patterns
- Demonstrate progress over time
- Make informed decisions together

**The key:** Pacing isn't about doing less forever. It's about building a foundation for doing MORE sustainably.
