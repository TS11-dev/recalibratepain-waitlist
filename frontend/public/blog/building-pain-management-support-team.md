## Introduction

Chronic pain is complex—and managing it effectively often requires more than a single healthcare provider or approach. Research consistently shows that multidisciplinary care produces better outcomes than isolated treatments.

But how do you build an effective pain management support team? Who should be on it? And how do you coordinate care across multiple providers?

This guide walks you through creating a comprehensive support network tailored to your unique pain management needs.

## Why Team-Based Care Matters

### The Evidence for Multidisciplinary Approaches

A wealth of research supports team-based chronic pain management:

- **Cochrane reviews** find multidisciplinary rehabilitation more effective than single-discipline treatments
- **Functional outcomes** improve more with coordinated care
- **Psychological wellbeing** is better addressed
- **Return-to-work rates** are higher
- **Long-term benefits** are more sustained

### The Complexity of Chronic Pain

Chronic pain affects multiple life domains, which is why multiple types of support are valuable:

| Domain | Impact | Support Needed |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Physical | Mobility, function, sleep | Physiotherapy, medicine |
| Psychological | Mood, anxiety, coping | Psychology, counseling |
| Social | Relationships, isolation | Support groups, family support |
| Occupational | Work capacity, productivity | Occupational therapy, vocational rehab |
| Lifestyle | Diet, exercise, habits | Health coaching, nutrition |

No single provider can address all these dimensions optimally.

- Belief in biopsychosocial approach

### 2. Pain Specialist/Pain Medicine Physician
