## What Causes Fibromyalgia Flares?

**Fibromyalgia flares are temporary worsenings of symptoms** that can last days to weeks. While they often feel random, research shows most flares have identifiable triggers.

**Common triggers include:**

**Physical factors:**
- Overexertion or "overdoing it"
- Poor sleep or sleep disruption
- Weather and temperature changes
- Infections or illness
- Hormonal fluctuations

**Emotional factors:**
- Stress (acute or chronic)
- Anxiety and worry
- Major life changes
- Grief or emotional trauma

**Lifestyle factors:**
- Dietary changes or trigger foods
- Disrupted routines
- Travel or schedule changes
- Dehydration

**The challenge:** Triggers are highly individual. What causes a flare for one person may not affect another at all.

## How Do I Identify MY Triggers?

**The key is systematic tracking over time.**

**What to track:**
- Daily symptoms (pain levels, fatigue, brain fog, etc.)
- Sleep quality and duration
- Activities and exercise
- Stress levels
- Weather conditions
- Food and hydration
- Menstrual cycle (if applicable)
- Medications and supplements

**Look for patterns:**
- What happened in the 24-72 hours before a flare?
- Are certain days of the week worse?
- Do flares follow specific activities?
- Are there seasonal patterns?

**Tips for effective tracking:**
- Be consistent (track daily, even when feeling okay)
- Note both good and bad days
- Include context (what made a good day good?)
- Review weekly to spot patterns

**Remember:** Some triggers have delayed effects. A stressful event Monday might not cause a flare until Wednesday.

## What Can I Do During a Flare?

**When a flare hits, focus on damage control and recovery.**

**Immediate strategies:**
- **Rest, but don't stop completely.** Gentle movement prevents deconditioning
- **Prioritize ruthlessly.** What MUST get done? Everything else can wait
- **Use heat or cold.** Whatever works for YOUR body
- **Stay hydrated.** Dehydration worsens symptoms
- **Practice self-compassion.** Flares aren't failures

**What NOT to do:**
- Push through and make it worse
- Cancel all activity (creates fear and avoidance)
- Blame yourself (flares happen despite best efforts)
- Make major decisions while flaring

**Flare duration guidelines:**
- Under 12 hours: Maintain modified activity
- 24-48 hours: Reduce activity significantly
- Over 48 hours: Focus on gentle movement and recovery basics

**After the flare:** Review what happened. What might have triggered it? What helped? Add to your knowledge bank.
